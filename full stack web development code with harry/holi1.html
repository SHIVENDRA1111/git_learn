    <h1>Holi</h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="myfirst" class="first">Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/) also known as the Festival of Colours, Festival of Spring, and
        Festival of Love, is one of the most popular and significant festivals in Hinduism.[1][9][1][10][11] It
        celebrates the eternal and divine love of the god Radha and Krishna.[12][13] The day also signifies the triumph
        of good over evil,[14][15] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over
        Hiranyakashipu.[16][17] It originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has also
        spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.

        Holi celebrates the arrival of Spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love, and for many, it
        is a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.[18][25]
        The festival is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[18][25] It lasts for a night and a day,
        starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which
        falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. The first evening is known as "Holika Dahan" or
        "Chhoti Holi" and the following day as "Holi", "Rangwali Holi", "Dol Purnima", "Dhuleti", "Dhulandi",[26]
        "Ukuli", "Manjal Kuli",[27] "Yaosang", "Shigmo",[28] "Phagwah",[29] or "Jajiri".[30]

        Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with the ritual of Holika Dahan where people gather and perform
        religious rituals in front of a bonfire and pray that their internal evils be destroyed the way Holika, the
        sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi
        (Dhuleti) where people smear and drench each other with colours. Water guns and water-filled balloons are often
        used to play and colour each other, with anyone and any place being considered fair game to color. Groups often
        carry drums and other musical instruments going from place to place singing and dancing. Throughout the day
        people visit family, and friends and foes come together to chat, enjoy food and drink, and partake in Holi
        delicacies.</p>
    <h2>cultuaral significance</h2>
    <hr>
    <p id="mysecond" class="second" style="color: rgba(31, 27, 59, 0.874); font-weight: 400; font-size: larger; ">The
        Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the
        Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting
        others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their
        lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new
        friends</p>
    <h3>Radha krishna</h3>
    <p id="mythird" class="third">In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the
        festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities
        officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love.[12][34] Garga Samhita, a puranic work by
        Sage Garga was the first literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi.[35]
        There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the
        fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation,
        asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha
        and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's face has been commemorated
        as Holi.[13][36] Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah) common in some
        Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.[37][38] It is also
        celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa.</p>
    <h3>Vishnu</h3>
    <p id="myfout=rth" class="third">There is a symbolic legend to explain why Holi is celebrated as a festival of
        triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada. King Hiranyakashipu father
        of Prahlada, according to a legend found in chapter 7 of Bhagavata Purana,[16][17] was the king of demonic
        Asuras, and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor
        an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor
        by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant,
        thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.[5] Hiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however,
        disagreed. He was and remained devoted to Vishnu.[31] This infuriated Hiranyakashipu. He subjected Prahlada to
        cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally,
        Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her.[5] Holika was wearing a cloak that
        made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire roared, the cloak flew from Holika and
        encased Prahlada,[31] who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore
        Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an
        animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither
        indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and
        killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).[40]

        The Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada
        over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika</p>

    <h3>History and rituals</h3>

    <p id="myfifth" class="fourth" style="background-color: darkgreen; font-style: italic;
        font-size: larger;">The Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its cultural rituals. It is mentioned
        in the Puranas, Dasakumara Charita, and by the poet Kālidāsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta
        II.[10] The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama Ratnavali.[61] The festival
        of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old
        editions of Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: Houly
        (1687), Hooly (1698), Huli (1789), Hohlee (1809), Hoolee (1825), and Holi in editions published after</p>
    <h3>Holika Dahan</h3>
    <p id="mysixth" class="sixth">According to the Puranas, a king named Hiranyakashipu, like many asuras, wished to be
        immortal. To fulfill this desire, he performed the required tapas until he was granted a boon by Brahma. The
        boon granted Hiranyakashipu five of his desires: that he would not die at the hands of any being created by
        Brahma, that he would not perish inside or outside, by day or night, by any weapon, on the earth or in the sky,
        by men or beasts, devas or asuras, that he be unequalled, that he possess undiminishing power, and that he be
        the one ruler of all creation. His wish granted, Hiranyakashipu felt invincible, and conquered the three worlds,
        assuming the throne of Indra.[3] He punished and killed anyone all those who objected to his supremacy. His son
        Prahlada, raised a Vaishnava, refused to worship his father as a deity. He continued believing in and
        worshipping Vishnu.
        
        This infuriated Hiranyakashipu, and he made various attempts to kill Prahlada. During one attempt on Prahlada's
        life, King Hiranyakashipu's sister, Holika, offered her help. According to the Vishnu Purana, Holika told her
        brother that due to a boon she had received, she was invulnerable to fire. Arrangements were made to have
        Prahlada sit upon the lap of his aunt, atop a burning pyre. However, as Prahlada chanted the name of Vishnu, he
        escaped unscathed, while Holika was incinerated.[4][5]
        
        In a variation of this Puranic legend, Hiranyakashipu had Holika don her scarf or her fireproof garment, so that
        his son may perish, and she may be protected atop the pyre. However, as the fire roared, the garment flew from
        Holika and covered Prahlada. Holika burnt to death, and Prahlada came out unharmed.[6][7]
        
        Vishnu appeared in the form of Narasimha (a half-human and half-lion avatara, one not created by Brahma), at
        dusk (neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashipu to his dwelling's threshold (neither indoors nor outdoors),
        placed him upon his lap (neither land, water, nor air), and then slew the king with his claws (not a weapon). In
        this manner, the comprehensive boon of Hiranyakashipu was no longer useful. Prahlada and the races of the three
        worlds were thus set free from the tyranny of Hiranyakashipu, and cosmic order was restored.[8]</p>

        <h4>Regional Name,ritual and celebration </h4>
        <p id="myseven" class="seven" style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 98); font-size: medium; font-style: italic;">
        Holi (Hindi: होली, Kannada: ಹೋಳಿ, Marathi: होळी, Nepali: होली, Punjabi: ਹੋਲੀ, Telugu: హోళి) is also known as Dol
        Jatra (Swing Festival) & Bôshonto Utshôb (Bengali: বসন্ত উৎসব) ("Spring festival") in West Bengal and Assam;
        Festival of Colours, or Dôl Jātrā (Assamese: দ’ল যাত্ৰা) in Assam, Phāgu Pūrṇimā (Nepali: फागु पूर्णिमा) in
        hilly region of Nepal, Dola jātra (Odia: ଦୋଳଯାତ୍ରା) in Odisha; also known as Phakuwa or Phagwah (Assamese:
        ফাকুৱা) and Fagua in bhojpuri (western Bihar). The customs and celebrations vary between regions of India.

        Holi is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with
        Radha Krishna: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Barsana and Gokula which become touristic during the season of
        Holi.[34]

        Outside India and Nepal, Holi is observed by Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan as well in countries with large
        Indian subcontinent diaspora populations such as Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Malaysia,
        Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Australia, New Zealand,
        Mauritius, and Fiji. The Holi rituals and customs outside South Asia also vary with local adaptations.</p>
    <h3>Bihar/Jharkhand</h3>
    <p
        style="background-color: grey; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
        Holi is known as Phaguwa in the local Bhojpuri dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is
        prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the
        Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At
        the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the
        lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with
        colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.[66]

        Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply
        colours (abeer) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually, this takes place on the evening of
        Holi, day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale
        internal migration issues faced by the people, recently, this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is
        common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.[67]

        Children and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with
        colours, in some places, people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are
        sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the dholak (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi.
        Intoxicating bhang, made from cannabis, milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering
        delicacies, such as pakoras and thandai, to enhance the mood of the festival.[68]</p>
        <h4>West Bengal</h4>
        <p style="background-color: hotpink; font-size:20px ; font-style: oblique;"> In West Bengal, Holi is known by the name of "Dol Jatra", "Dol Purnima" or the "Swing Festival". In Shantiniketan, West Bengal, Holi is known as “Basanta Utsav”. The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the icons of Radha and Krishna on a picturesquely decorated palanquin which is then taken round the main streets of the city or the village. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, students (mainly in Shantiniketan) dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the ektara, dubri, and Veena. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing songs. During these activities, the people keep throwing coloured water and dry colours, abir, at them</p>
        <h4>The holi powder</h4>
        <h6>Health impact</h6>
    <p style="background-color: fuchsia; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: inherit;">A 2007 study found that malachite green, a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.[122]

        Another 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labelling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several non-governmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.[123]
        
        These reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi's CLEAN India campaign,[124] Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune,[125] Society for Child Development through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign[126] have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market "herbal" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.
        
        In urban areas, some people wear nose masks and sunglasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.</p>
        <h4>Environmental impact</h4>
        <p style="background-color: indianred; font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">n alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. Activists estimate Holika 30,000 bonfires every year during Holi, with each one burning approximately 100 kilograms (220.46 lbs) of wood.[128] This represents less than 0.0001% of 350 million tons of wood India consumes every year, as one of the traditional fuels for cooking and other uses.[129]

            The use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary wastewater pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days</p>
            <h2>conclusion</h2>
            <p style="color: darkred; font-style: italic; font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; border-radius: 10px;">As a country of numerous cultures, ethnicities and faiths, India celebrates countless festivals in its calendar throughout the year. Among the most largely known festivals, we find Holi – in simple terms the celebration of colors but as we dive a little deeper, Holi seems to bring with it a plethora of meanings and historical, cultural and traditional significance.

                Holi, to some people, is the festival of love shared by Radha and Krishna – a form of love that needs no specific name, form or shape. To others, it is a story of how the good in us always emerges victorious over the evil. While for many others, Holi is an opportunity of fun, frolic, forgiveness and compassion. Spread over three days, the Holi rituals begin with the destruction of evil symbolized by a bonfire on the first day and celebration with colors, prayers, music, dance and blessings on the other two days. The primary colors used represent various emotions and elements like blue for Lord Krishna, red for fertility and love and green for new beginnings.
                
                The festival of Holi finds a place not only in our real life but also in art, media and music as various songs, movies and shows mention Holi with diverse forms and references. More often than not, people embrace this occasion to wipe memories of hurt and anguish and replace them with brotherhood, kindness and enjoyment. People across the barriers of age, generations, caste and creed become a part of the celebrations in all their colors.
                
                In recent times, the spirit of Holi has lost its charm due to the excessive use of intoxication, artificial and potentially harmful color and other irresponsible incidents. It is, thus, necessary to keep the “fun” alive but also preserve the festival for what it signifies – love, happiness and the sustenance of good over evil</p>
