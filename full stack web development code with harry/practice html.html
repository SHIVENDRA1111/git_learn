        Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/) is an ancient Hindu tradition and also one of the most popular festivals in Hinduism.[1][9] It
        celebrates the eternal and divine love of god Radha Krishna.[10][11] The day also signifies the triumph of good
        over evil,[12][13] as it commemorates the victory of god Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over
        Hiranyakashipu.[14][15] It was originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent but has
        also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.</p>

    <h2>Cultural Fest</h2>
    <p>The Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is
        the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and
        forgive. People  <em>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Rerum, exercitationem?</em> pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start
        of spring, an occasion  <strong>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quo in deserunt aut voluptatem ab.</strong> for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends</p>
    <h3>Radhe krishna</h3>
    <p>n the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until
        Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities officially usher in spring,
        with Holi celebrated as a festival of love.[10][34] Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first
        literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi.[35] There is also a popular
        symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like
        him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha
        and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple.

    <p>This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's
        face has been commemorated as Holi.[11][36] Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi
        (Phagwah) are common in some Caribbean and South American communities of Indian origin such as Guyana and
        Trinidad and Tobago.[37][38] It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius</p>
